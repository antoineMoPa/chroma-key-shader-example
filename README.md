# chroma-key-shader-example

## Running the app

You can quickly start the app with:

```
npm start
```

This will start the Express server on port 3333 and serve the current directory as static files.

## Adding the example video

Make sure to add an `example.mp4` video file in the root folder of the project. The app expects to load the video from `http://localhost:3333/example.mp4`. Without this video file present, the app will show a blank or static frame but no playback.

Place your `.mp4` video named `example.mp4` in the folder where you run `npm start`.
